Fleabag series 2 review
Phoebe Waller-Bridge returns with the follow-up to the first season of her sharp, shocking and critically-acclaimed comedy. Caryn James takes a look. Of course, Fleabag would fall for a priest. What could be more emotionally self-defeating, darkly hilarious, or more true to the character we came to know in season one of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s mordant series? Fleabag - the character has no other name - is both heroine and anti-heroine, using sex and humour as her armour while she blunders her way through life. Written by and starring Waller-Bridge, the series has an unmistakable voice, with witty irreverence turning into piercingly sad emotion. Waller-Bridge makes it seem so effortless that it’s easy to underestimate how inventive the programme is.-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190228-ten-tv-shows-to-watch-in-march">Ten TV shows to watch in March</a>-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190206-rita-how-the-hit-danish-dramedy-went-global">Rita: How the Danish dramedy went global</a>-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ', <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190226-sex-sells-the-new-age-of-explicit-tv">The new age of sexually explicit TV</a>Season two picks up 371 days, 19 hours and 26 minutes after the events of the first series, which ended with a giant revelation about the grief Fleabag had been carrying around. She had slept with her best friend’s boyfriend, causing the friend to intentionally walk into the path of a bike and be killed. There is no escaping that knowledge, and this season carries a slightly darker tone. \xa0Episode one takes place over a single evening with her family, at a restaurant dinner to celebrate her widowed father’s (Bill Paterson) engagement to Godmother (no other name for her either). In one of her many asides to the camera, Fleabag tells us at the start, with an especially mischievous look “This is a love story.” That can’t end well.<div class="inline-media inline-image">
