    President Trump declares a national emergency on the southern border in a bid to divert billions toward border security; reaction from talk titan Rush Limbaugh."Both parties have people that are still trying to get rid of Donald Trump," Limbaugh said, asserting that Democrats are also working to guarantee a "permanent underclass of voters" who are "uneducated" and "don&apost even speak" English."The purpose of this bill, I think, was eventually to be used by the Democrats and some Republicans to tell the American people, &aposSee, electing President Trump was pointless, worthless, he can&apost protect you, he can&apost stop us, he can&apost do what he said he was going to do, because we hate him so much we&aposre not going to allow him to do it -- that&aposs what this bill is," Limbaugh said."It&aposs just another effort to continue to try to diminish the president -- diminish President Trump as someone who doesn&apost know what he&aposs doing, can&apost do it without guidance from the wacko right," Limbaugh told host Chris Wallace. "It&aposs not at all the way he&aposs governing, and there isn&apost anybody doing what I do that has a thing to do with actually making policy for this president."MCCABE, ROSENSTEIN NEED TO TESTIFY ON PLOT TO REMOVE PRESIDENT VIA 25TH AMENDMENT, TOP GOP OFFICIALS SAYThe bill provided additional funding for 5,000 more beds that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can use to house illegal immigrants. But in an attempt to pressure the agency to detain fewer illegal immigrants, Democrats ensured that the bill did not include funding for the 2,000 additional ICE agents requested by the Trump administration, or the 750 Border Patrol agents that were also sought.Several Republicans, including Texas Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Chip Roy, voted against the bill, saying it didn&apost properly address the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs across the border. Roy called the bill a "sham," and said the funding bill "undermines the whole point of an emergency declaration.""We have an emergency -- this is an invasion.""The very existence and definition of American culture, American society, the rule of law -- why does nobody talk about the fact that millions and millions and millions of people are breaking the law here illegally and the Democrat Party wants that to happen?" Limbaugh asked.Pressed by Wallace on his pervious criticisms of sweeping executive actions by former President Obama, Limbaugh said, "What Obama was doing was furthering this existing problem. ... Yes, I objected to that, but primarily because of what he was doing with these executive powers."Former Clinton adviser Mark Penn on fallout from former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's allegations.The testimony was delivered last fall to the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.

"These guys, if you ask me, ought to be the ones in jail.""The frontrunner would probably be right now Joe Biden, 77 years old, plagiarist, nicknamed &aposplugs&apos -- I think he&aposs the guy they are probably thinking is the leader in the polls right now," Limbaugh said. "But it&aposs going to be very crowded. They&aposre going to be knocking each other off. That&aposs going to be fun to watch. Incumbancy carries with it a lot of power. ... They&aposre getting way ahead of the game, and I don&apost think it&aposs going to be as easy as they think."Fox News&apos Mike Emanuel and Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.
